                <li>Read the instructions carefully before beginning the quiz.</li>

                <li>The quiz will consist of multiple choice questions. Choose the correct answer from the options
                    provided.</li>

                <li>Each question will have a time limit, so read and answer the questions quickly.</li>

                <li>Do not spend too much time on a single question. If you are unsure of an answer, move on to the next
                    question and come back to it later if time permits.</li>

                <li>Do not cheat or use any unauthorized materials during the quiz.</li>

                <li>You will not be able to go back to previous questions once you have moved on to the next question,
                    so make sure you answer each question to the best of your ability before moving on.</li>

                <li>Once you have answered all the questions, submit your quiz and wait for the results.</li>

                <li>The competitor with the highest score will be declared the winner.</li>

                <li>In case of a tie, the competitor who completed the quiz in the shortest time will be declared the
                    winner.</li>

                <li>Remember to have fun and do your best!</li>
